 a WAR file (or Web application ARchive) is added for testing the Application based on REST API.
 
 These are the spteps to run and test the war using Apache Tomcat (7 or later versions) in Windows Operating System.
 1. Find the webapps folder for your Apache server direcory.
 2. Download the REST.war file (from this repository) and save it to that webapps folder.
 3. Now, run cmd.exe and go to the bin folder for your Apache server direcory.
 4. Write startup.bat and hit enter. This will start your apache server and deploy the REST war on server.
 5. Open a browser to send GET requests to your newly started server.
 6. Type "http://localhost:8080/REST/TemperatureConverter/celsiustofahrenheit/" in your browser and hit enter. 
 This will display a convertion of a default value.
 7. To test a convertion of a celsius value 50, use "http://localhost:8080/REST/TemperatureConverter/celsiustofahrenheit/50" 
 and hit enter.
 8. In a similar manner, we can test fahrenheit to celsius convertion using
 "http://localhost:8080/REST/TemperatureConverter/fahrenheittocelsius/" for default value and
 "http://localhost:8080/REST/TemperatureConverter/fahrenheittocelsius/120" for fahrenheit value 120.
